# Guess the Race Track

Guess the Race Track is a web app designed for motorsport enthusiasts who want to test their knowledge of racing circuits through interactive games.

This project is primarily an experimentation ground for me, allowing for hands-on learning in web development with Django. It serves as a platform to explore and learn things like WebSockets, background tasks, database management, Docker, server setup and maintenance, as well as overall system design.

Rather than being a polished product, this app is an evolving project where new ideas and technologies can be tested in a practical setting. Itâ€™s a fun way to build experience with web development while also creating something enjoyable.

ðŸ“Œ More to come!
